# Academic Credential Verification System

A blockchain-based solution for preventing fake university degrees by storing tamper-proof credential hashes on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system addresses the critical issue of academic credential forgery by leveraging blockchain technology to create an immutable, verifiable record of academic achievements. Universities can issue credentials that are instantly verifiable by employers, eliminating the need for time-consuming verification processes.

### Key Features

- **Tamper-Proof Storage**: All credentials are stored as Keccak256 hashes on the blockchain
- **Instant Verification**: Verify any credential in seconds without contacting universities
- **University Consortium**: Only authorized universities can issue credentials
- **Public Verification**: Open access for credential verification
- **Cost-Effective**: One-time issuance fee with unlimited verifications

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract (`AcademicCredential.sol`)

- **Credential Issuance**: Universities can issue new academic credentials
- **Credential Verification**: Public verification of credential authenticity
- **Credential Revocation**: Ability to revoke compromised credentials
- **Authority Management**: Control over which universities can issue credentials
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging for transparency

### Frontend Application

- **React-based UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with Material-UI
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask integration for blockchain interactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live blockchain data and transaction status
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all device sizes

## 📱 Usage Guide

### For Universities

1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the application
2. **Issue Credentials**: Use the "Issue Credential" page to create new academic credentials
3. **Manage Authority**: Contract owners can add/remove university authorities

### For Employers/Verifiers

1. **Verify Credentials**: Use the "Verify Credential" page to check credential authenticity
2. **View Details**: Access comprehensive credential information
3. **No Registration Required**: Public verification without account creation

### For Students

1. **Receive Credentials**: Get your credentials from authorized universities
2. **Share Hash**: Share your credential hash with employers for verification
3. **Track Status**: Monitor your credential status and validity
